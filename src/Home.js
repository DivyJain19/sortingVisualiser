                description="The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is considered as an example of the divide and conquer strategy. So, in this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner. We can think of it as a recursive algorithm that continuously splits the array in half until it cannot be further divided. This means that if the array becomes empty or has only one element left, the dividing will stop, i.e. it is the base case to stop the recursion. If the array has multiple elements, we split the array into halves and recursively invoke the merge sort on each of the halves. Finally, when both the halves are sorted, the merge operation is applied. Merge operation is the process of taking two smaller sorted arrays and combining them to eventually make a larger one."
                complexity="The time complexity of MergeSort is O(n*Log n) in all the 3 cases (worst, average and best) as the mergesort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves."

The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part."
                complexity="The worst-case (and average-case) complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is O(nÂ²). Meaning that, in the worst case, the time taken to sort a list is proportional to the square of the number of elements in the list. The best-case time complexity of insertion sort algorithm is O(n) time complexity."
